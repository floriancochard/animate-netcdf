## Version History Note

**Version Jump Explanation**: The version jumped from 1.0.2 to 1.6.0 during the setup of automated deployment infrastructure. This was an administrative change to establish proper CI/CD workflows and does not represent a proportional increase in features. Future releases will follow normal semantic versioning from 1.6.0 onwards.
